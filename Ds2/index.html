            <h1 id="sobre">SOBRE NÓS</h1>
           <p id="description">Streetwear culture is a fashion movement that emerged from the streets, particularly within urban subcultures like skateboarding and hip-hop, during the 1980s and 1990s. <br> With a laid-back style focused on comfort, streetwear is characterized by casual and practical clothing, such as sneakers, oversized t-shirts, hoodies, and baggy pants, often featuring bold logos, <br> graphics, and prints. Additionally, this style is deeply influenced by street art, graffiti, and music, especially rap and hip-hop, and carries a spirit of rebellion and individuality. <br> Many streetwear brands have become icons, such as Supreme, Off-White, and BAPE, whose limited-edition releases and exclusive collaborations create a sense of scarcity and desire among consumers. <br>

            Streetwear, however, is not just about clothing; it is also a form of cultural and social expression, reflecting the <br>values and attitudes of urban youth. The exclusivity of items, often released in limited-edition or collaborative drops, is a defining <br>characteristic of this universe. Streetwear brands understand that scarcity adds value, and they frequently "drop" (release) products that sell out quickly, fueling a culture of desire and the constant <br> search for items that become symbols of status and belonging.
            
            In this context, online sales platforms like the store "Drop" stand out <br> for directly catering to the audience looking to engage with and connect to this culture. Drop’s concept is to offer a carefully <br>curated selection of streetwear brands and products, in line with the aesthetics and trends of the movement. <br> The name "Drop" itself refers to the common practice in streetwear, where collections and products are released in limited quantities, generating an appeal of exclusivity. <br> Thus, the site is not just a clothing store but also a meeting point for enthusiasts of this lifestyle, providing easy <br> access to sought-after pieces from renowned brands, as well as fresh releases and exclusive partnerships. <br>
            
            Moreover, Drop connects with the digital culture and social media, which are essential in streetwear marketing. Influencers and figures from the worlds <br>of music and urban art promote the clothing and trends, helping to solidify the relationship between consumers and the brand. <br>The convenience of being able to purchase these items from anywhere, combined with exclusivity and a sense of belonging, makes Drop an ideal platform <br> for those wanting to stay on top of the latest trends in this style, while remaining authentic and connected to the urban culture it represents. <br></p>
